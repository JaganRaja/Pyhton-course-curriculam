<h1 id="python-programming">Python Programming</h1>
<p>Python has simple easy-to-use syntax and it is a general-purpose language. It has wide range of applications from Web development (like: Django and Bottle), scientific and mathematical computing (Orange, SymPy, NumPy) to desktop graphical user Interfaces (Pygame, Panda3D).</p>
<h3 id="applications-of-python">Applications of Python</h3>
<p><strong>Web Applications</strong></p>
<p>You can create scalable Web Apps using frameworks and CMS (Content Management System) that are built on Python. Some of the popular platforms for creating Web Apps are: Django, Flask, Pyramid, Plone, Django CMS.</p>
<p>Sites like Mozilla, Reddit, Instagram and PBS are written in Python.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific and Numeric Computing</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous libraries available in Python for scientific and numeric computing. There are libraries like: SciPy and NumPy that are used in general purpose computing. And, there are specific libraries like: EarthPy for earth science, AstroPy for Astronomy and so on.</p>
<p>Also, the language is heavily used in machine learning, data mining and deep learning.</p>
<p><strong>Creating software Prototypes</strong></p>
<p>Python is slow compared to compiled languages like C++ and Java. It might not be a good choice if resources are limited and efficiency is a must.</p>
<p>However, Python is a great language for creating prototypes. For example: You can use Pygame (library for creating games) to create your game’s prototype first. If you like the prototype, you can use language like C++ to create the actual game.</p>
<p><strong>Good Language to Teach Programming</strong></p>
<p>Python is used by many companies to teach programming to kids and newbies.</p>
<p>It is a good language with a lot of features and capabilities. Yet, it’s one of the easiest language to learn because of its simple easy-to-use syntax.</p>
